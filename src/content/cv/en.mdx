# Who am I

My name is Jean-CÃ©dric Huet. I'm a web developer based in Montreal who loves tech, the web, tacos and everything in between.

I am a self-taught developer who has been coding every day since late 2017. With some background in technology in college, I had a solid foundations to move forward into a different branch of programming. My plans were to build a sideline of income and work my way from there. About 3 years later, I now feel confident to move forward in my career and work in a professional setting.

I have collaborated with different people online on code, exchanged ideas and learnt from prominent devs. This is why I think I'm more than ready to work in a team setting for big projects!
